# Visualsing metrics

To visualise metrics - just load up the 'Testing DV Metrics.ipynb' file, read in 'all_results.pkl' and 'combined_metrics.pkl' and run all the cells.
You should then be able to plot graphs and charts.

There are 2 Precision Settings * 2 Keyword Settings * 4 Models * 13 Garm categories * 11 metrics = 2288 different charts available!
